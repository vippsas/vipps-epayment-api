# Customer-Present Payments

When using the ePayments API to process payments in a physical setting, from a POS device, or in a restaurant for example, the payment must be flagged with `"customerInteraction": "CUSTOMER_PRESENT"`.

`CUSTOMER_PRESENT` marking is required for compliance and reporting reasons.
