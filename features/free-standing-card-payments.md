# Free-standing card payments

The ePayment API supports free-standing card payments (FSCP),
where any user can pay regardless of having the Vipps app installed.
See
[FAQ: Card payments](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/faqs/users-and-payments-faq/#card-payments).

## Create a free-standing card payment

Remember to have a fresh access token, see 
[Setup and Authorize](../quick-start.md#step-1---setup).
Then, call the [Create Payment][create-payment-endpoint] endpoint with `paymentMethod.type = "CARD"`.


```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: UNIQUE-ID" \
-H "Merchant-Serial-Number: YOUR-MERCHANT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "amount": {
    "currency": "NOK",
    "value": 1000
  },
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "CARD"
  },
  "reference": "UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE",
  "returnUrl": "https://yourwebsite.come/redirect?reference=abcc123",
  "userFlow": "WEB_REDIRECT",
  "paymentDescription": "A simple free standing card payment"
}'
```

## Complete the payment

The result of this request will contain a `redirectUrl` pointing to the card entry page.

:::note
The card entry page currently is not currently available in the
[test environment)(https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/test-environment/).
