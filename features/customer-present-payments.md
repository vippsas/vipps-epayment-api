# Customer-present payments

When using the ePayment API to process payments in a physical setting (e.g.,  from a Point Of Sale device, in a restaurant), the payment must be flagged with `"customerInteraction": "CUSTOMER_PRESENT"`.

`CUSTOMER_PRESENT` marking is required for compliance and reporting reasons.
