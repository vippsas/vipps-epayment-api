The ePayment API is the successor to the [eCommerce API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/ecom-api).
The ePayment API allows merchants to accept payments using the following payment methods:

* Vipps Wallet
* Credit and debit cards

Merchants can do the following:

* [Create the payment](create/README.md)
<!-- START_COMMENT -->
* [Query the payment](queries/README.md)
<!-- END_COMMENT -->
* [Capture, refund, and cancel payment](modifications/README.md)
