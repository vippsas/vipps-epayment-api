<!-- START_COMMENT -->

ℹ️ Please use the new documentation:
[Vipps Technical Documentation](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/epayment-api).

<!-- END_COMMENT -->

The ePayment API allows you to create payments using the following user flows:

* Open the [Vipps landing page](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/common-topics/vipps-landing-page).
* Open the Vipps app on the user's mobile phone.
* Cause a notification from the user's Vipps app.
* Generate a QR code that a user can scan to send the request to their Vipps app.

You can also get payment details, get user info, capture payments, and refund payments.

To get started, see the [ePayment getting started guide](getting-started.md).
