# How ePayment works in the store

Enable your customers to pay easily and quickly from their own phone, without the need to touch the terminal.
Offer contactless payment to your customers by integrating the ePayment API into your POS system.

It is also possible to use our simpler solution, *Vipps number*, but then the amount must be entered manually at checkout, and there will be some follow-up with accounting and settlement.
