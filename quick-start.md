# Quick start

## Before you begin

This document covers the quick steps for getting started with the ePayment API.
You must have already signed up as a organisation with Vipps MobilePay and have your test credentials from the merchant portal, as described in the
[Vipps Quick start guide](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/getting-started).

<!-- START_COMMENT -->
<!--
Once your merchant account is setup for Merchant Payments, you should look at available configuration options, such as
[Notifications Webhooks](how-to-setup-notification-webhooks.md).

## Your first Vipps Payment


### Step 1 - Setup
<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

Save the following files to your computer:

* [ePayment API Postman collection](tools/vipps-epayment-api-postman-collection.json)
* [Global Postman environment](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/tools/vipps-api-global-postman-environment.json)

Then, import the Postman files

1. In Postman, click *Import* in the upper-left corner.
1. In the dialog that opens, with *File* selected, click *Upload Files*.
1. Select the two files you have just downloaded and click *Import*.

Lastly, tweak the Postman environment with your own secrets

1. Click the down arrow, next to the "eye" icon in the top-right corner, and select the environment you have imported.
2. Click the "eye" icon and, in the dropdown window, click `Edit` in the top-right corner.
3. Fill in the `Current Value` for the following fields to get started.
   For the first keys, go to *Vipps Portal* > *Utvikler* ->  *Test Keys*.
    * `client_id` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
    * `client_secret` - Merchant key is required for getting the access token.
    * `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` - Merchant subscription key.
    * `merchantSerialNumber` - Merchant id.
    * `internationalMobileNumber` - The MSISDN for the test app profile you have received or registered. This is your test mobile number *including* country code.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

No setup needed :)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

Install the Vipps .NET SDK to your project

```csharp
dotnet add package vipps.net
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2 - Authentication

For all of the following, you will need an `access_token` from the [Get Access Token][access-token-endpoint] endpoint.
This provides you with access to the API.

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Get Access Token
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/accessToken/get \
-H "client_id: YOUR-CLIENT-ID" \
-H "client_secret: YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-X POST \
--data ''
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

The Vipps-net SDK will handle Access Token fetching for you, all you need to do is to add the following configuration code

```csharp
var vippsConfigurationOptions = new VippsConfigurationOptions
{
    ClientId = YOUR-CLIENT-ID,
    ClientSecret = YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET,
    MerchantSerialNumber = YOUR-MERCHANT-SERIAL-NUMBER,
    SubscriptionKey = YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY,
    UseTestMode = true // TODO?
};

VippsConfiguration.ConfigureVipps(vippsConfigurationOptions);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


The property `access_token` should be used for all other API requests in the `Authorization` header as the Bearer token.

### Step 3 - A simple ePayment payment with web redirect

Initiate a payment via the [Create Payment][create-payment-endpoint] endpoint.
In this example, we use the default user flow, `WEB_REDIRECT`.
This provides you with a link you can click to go to the landing page. When your test mobile number (with country code)
is provided, it will be prefilled in the form.

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Create Payment - Web redirect
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: UNIQUE-ID" \
-H "Merchant-Serial-Number: YOUR-MERCHANT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "amount": {
    "currency": "NOK",
    "value": 1000
  },
  "paymentMethod": {
    "type": "WALLET"
  },
  "customer": {
    "phoneNumber": "YOUR-TEST-PHONE-NUMBER (NB! MSISDN format)"
  },
  "reference": "UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE",
  "returnUrl": "https://yourwebsite.come/redirect?reference=abcc123",
  "userFlow": "WEB_REDIRECT",
  "paymentDescription": "A simple payment"
}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var reference = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
var customerPhoneNumber = "YOUR-TEST-PHONE-NUMBER (NB! MSISDN format)";
var createPaymentRequest = new CreatePaymentRequest
    {
        Amount = new Amount
        {
            Currency = Currency.NOK,
            Value = 1000 // 1000 Ã¸re = 10 KR
        },
        PaymentMethod = new PaymentMethod { Type = PaymentMethodType.WALLET },
        UserFlow = CreatePaymentRequestUserFlow.WEB_REDIRECT,
        Reference = reference,
        PaymentDescription = "Two pair of socks and one coffee",
        ReturnUrl = $"https://no.where.com/{reference}",
        Customer = new Customer { PhoneNumber = customerPhoneNumber }
    };
var createPaymentResult = await EpaymentService.CreatePayment(createPaymentRequest);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



### Step 4 - Completing the payment

*Ctrl+click* (*Command-click* on macOS) on the link that appears and it will take you to the Vipps landing page.
The phone number of your test user should already be filled in, so you only have to click "Next".
You will be presented with the payment in the Vipps app, where you can complete or reject the payment.
Once you have acted upon the payment you will be redirected back to the specified `returnUrl` under a "best effort" policy.

:::note
We cannot guarantee the user will be redirected back to the same browser or session, or that they will at all be redirected back. User interaction can be unpredictable and the user may choose to fully close the Vipps app or browser.
:::

### Step 5 - Getting the status of the payment

<!-- START_COMMENT -->
<!--
The preferred way to receive status updates on a payment is to subscribe to Webhooks. Insert more info here
[Notifications Webhooks](how-to-setup-notification-webhooks.md).

### Notification Events

If you are not dependent on getting the payment result immediately, you may also use notification events to receive the payment status update via our [Notification Webhooks](how-to-setup-notification-webhooks.md) service. While we aim to deliver these event updates within a few seconds of the user completing the payment, this service has an eventual delivery guarantee rather than immediate delivery.
:::info
This means we may deliver the same message several times to verify successful delivery, use the `pspReference` field for duplicate delivery checking.
:::

If you use the notification service, you will receive events in the same format as those in the array list returned from the [Get Payment Events][get-payment-event-log-endpoint] endpoint.
For example, a successful authentication event would look like
```json
{
 "reference": "UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE",
 "pspReference": "497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08",
 "name": "CREATED",
 "success": true,
 "amount": {
   "currency": "NOK",
   "value": 1000
 },
 "timestamp": "2021-02-24T14:15:22Z",
 "idempotencyKey": "IDEMPOTENCY-KEY-OF-REQUEST"
}
```
If the user had rejected the payment, the event would look like
```json
{
  "reference": "UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE",
  "pspReference": "38ab3a93-a819-4982-912d-089f3177e6c8",
  "name": "TERMINATED",
  "success": true,
  "amount": {
    "currency": "NOK",
    "value": 1000
  },
  "timestamp": "2021-02-24T14:15:12Z"
}
```
-->
<!-- END_COMMENT -->

To receive the result of the user action you may poll the status of the payment via the [Get Payment][get-payment-endpoint].

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Get payment
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments/UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-X GET
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var payment = await EpaymentService.GetPayment(reference);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


To verify that a payment has been authorized by the user, check that the `state` property is marked `AUTHORIZED`. If the user has instead chosen to reject the payment or chosen to click `cancel` on the landing page or in the Vipps App, the `state` property will be marked `ABORTED`. If the user did not act within the payment expiration time, the `state` property will be marked `EXPIRED`.

For more details of the lifecycle of the payment session the [Get Payment event log][get-payment-event-log-endpoint] endpoint.

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Get payment event log
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments/UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE/events \

-X GET
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var paymentEventLog = await EpaymentService.GetPaymentEventLog(reference);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 6 - Capture the payment

After the goods or services have been delivered, you can capture the authorized amount either partially or fully. Send a [Capture Request][capture-payment-endpoint].

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Capture payment
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments/UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE/capture \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: UNIQUE-ID" \
-H "Merchant-Serial-Number: YOUR-MERCHANT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "modificationAmount": {
    "currency": "NOK",
    "value": 1000
  }
}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var captureAmount = new Amount() { Value = 1000, Currency = Currency.NOK };
var captureResult = await EpaymentService.CapturePayment(
reference,
new CaptureModificationRequest { ModificationAmount = captureAmount });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

for more details about the types of captures.

### (Optional) Step 7 - Refund the payment

To refund the captured amount, either partially or fully, send a [Refund Request][refund-payment-endpoint].

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Refund payment
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash
curl https://apitest.vipps.no/epayment/v1/payments/UNIQUE-PAYMENT-REFERENCE/refund \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: UNIQUE-ID" \
-H "Merchant-Serial-Number: YOUR-MERCHANT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" \
-X POST \
-d '{
  "modificationAmount": {
    "currency": "NOK",
    "value": 1000
  }
}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

```csharp
var refundAmount = new Amount() { Value = 1000, Currency = Currency.NOK };
var refundResult = await EpaymentService.RefundPayment(
reference,
new RefundModificationRequest { ModificationAmount = refundAmount });
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

See
[Common topics: refund](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-developers/common-topics/refund)
for more details about refunds.

### (Optional) Step 8 - Cancel the payment

To cancel the payment, either fully or after a partial capture, send a [Cancel Request][cancel-payment-endpoint].

<Tabs
defaultValue="postman"
groupId="sdk-choice"
values={[
{label: 'Postman', value: 'postman'},
{label: 'curl', value: 'curl'},
]}>
<TabItem value="postman">

```bash
Send request Cancel payment
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```bash

-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Idempotency-Key: UNIQUE-ID" \
-H "Merchant-Serial-Number: YOUR-MERCHANT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER" \
-X POST
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="csharp">

``` csharp
var cancelResult = await EpaymentService.CancelPayment(reference);
